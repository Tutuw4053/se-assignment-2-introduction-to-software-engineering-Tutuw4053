# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Ans.
Software egineering ;It is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop software applications and systems. It encompasses a disciplined and structured approach to software development, focusing  on coding and the entire software development lifecycle, including  gathering requirements, designing, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Ans.
1. Requirements Analysis: Entails gathering and documenting user requirements.
2. Design: Creating a plan and a blueprint of the system architecture and interface.
3. 	Implementation:This is the execution or putting into an action the designed plan based on the design specifications.
4. 	Testing: Evaluating the software to ensure it meets the requirements and functions .
5. 	Deployment: this is where you releasing the software for use in the market after it has been tsted right.
6. Maintenance: Involves making updates, fixing bugs, and enhancing the software as needed to make it better.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Ans.
Agile and waterfalls are both models/methods used to manage projects. howerever,
In agile; There is iterative, incremental approach to project development and management, as well flexicibilty. It's thus hard to manage but easily accommodate changes whereas, Waterfall models;the approaches are linear and squencial as well as rigid. Hence there is clear structure and documentation making it easy to manage but difficut to make changes.
-Therefore, Agile is prefered for Long term projects whereas waterfall model for short term projects.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Ans.
Requirements engineering involves eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and managing software requirements throughout the development process.
 It ensures that the final product meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders and users statisfactions.
 the requirment engineering process include:
 1. Feasibility study
 2. Elicitation
 3. specification
 4. verification and validation
 5. management

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Ans.
Modularity is a fundamental design principle in software egineering aimed at creating software in away to minimize dependencies among components of systems.
It improve maintainability by isolating changes and reducing complexcity while enhancing scalability by allowing easy addition or removal of components.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Ans.
levels of software testing includes:
Unit Testing: That is testing individual components or modules.
Integration Testing:Involves testing the integration of multiple components.
System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Here we evaluate the system's compliance with user requirements.

-Testing is crucial in software development as it helps in identifying defects early, ensuring software quality, and validating that the software meets the specified/ standard requirements.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Ans
Version control systems Are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source codes over time, It allows multiple developers to collaborate simultaneously while maintaining a history of revisions. It also protect the source code from any unintended human error.
-Examples include Git (with features like branching and merging).

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Ans
A software project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. 
-His?her key responsibilities includes: defining project scope, allocating resources, managing risks, and ensuring timely delivery of the project.
-Some of the challenges faced by the manager includes:  changing requirements , resource constraints, and strict project timelines.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ans.
Software maintenance;Is the process of modifying, updating, and enhancing software systems or modules to resolve errors, improve performance, and adapt to changing user needs and expectations as well as expectation of stakeholders.
Types of maintenance activities include:
a.Corrective; fixing errors and bugs, 
adding new features, 
b. adaptive maintenance; improving performance/updating the software to suit the new hardware of software systems and the cost considerations.
C.Perfective; improving performance, functionality and reliability
d. Preventive; taking measures to prevent future risks and problems
therefore, there is need for regular testing and validation, version control and communications with the teams and stakeholders.
It's essential for prolonging the lifespan and value of software systems.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ans.
Some of the ethical issues software engineer mayface include:
 privacy violations, biases in algorithms, and the impact of technology on society. 
 Software engineers can adhere to ethical standards by prioritizing user privacy, ensuring fairness in algorithms, and promoting transparency and accountability in their work.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
